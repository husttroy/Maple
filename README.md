# Slicer

Slicer is highly extensible. Slicer uses the Strategy design pattern to register data processing mechanisms for BOA output files. Slicer can be easily augmented to process new types of BOA outputs by extending the ProcessStrategy class.

Run the scripts in CodeMiner, download BOA outputs, and put all txt files in the example folder.

To mine patterns from API call sequences, please install pymining first using 'pip install pymining'.
